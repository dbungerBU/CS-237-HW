# INPUT:
# Eight integer numbers, 0 <= X1, Y1, X2, T2, X3, Y3, X4, Y4 <= 10, such that:
# (X1, Y1) is the bottom-left coordinate of the first rectangle;
# (X2, Y2) is the top-right coordinate of the  first rectangle;
# (X3, Y3) is the bottom-left coordinate of the second rectangle;
# (X4, Y4) is the top-right coordinate of the second rectangle;

# OUTPUT
# The probability of hitting the intersection area if a dart is thrown randomly within the 10x10 region.
# Your answer should be expressed as float number within the interval [0.0,1.0]
